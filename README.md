You'll need to do a few things to make this template function with GitHub pages

---

### 1. Create a new repo from this template

---

### 2. Activate GitHub pages in the new repository settings

---
You'll need to set it to deploy from a branch, select `main` as the branch to deploy from, select the `docs/` folder as the deployment location, and then click save.

---

### 3. Add your GitHub pages `url` (once generated, it may take a moment) to the `_pkgdown.yml`

---

You can find the URL once generated on the GitHub Pages settings or by going to your repo `About` settings (click the gear icon next to About) and checking the box to add your site URL.

---

### 4. Wait a minute or two and then check your new sites functionality

---

Is everything working correctly? Do you site pages work when you click the links?
